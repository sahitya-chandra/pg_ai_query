Here is the SQL query you requested:

```json
{
  "sql": "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_orders, customer_id FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 5",
  "explanation": "This query counts orders per customer and filters to show only customers with more than 5 orders.",
  "warnings": [],
  "suggested_visualization": "bar_chart"
}
```

Let me know if you need any modifications!
